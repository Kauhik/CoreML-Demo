# Movie Recommendation System with Core ML

This project demonstrates a hybrid movie recommendation system using **Create MLâ€™s MLRecommender** (for collaborative filtering) and a custom **content-based filtering** engine in Swift. It leverages Core ML, SwiftUI, and genre-based similarity to generate personalized movie suggestions.

---

## Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering uses userâ€“item interactions to learn latent preferences and generate recommendations.

### Data

- `ratings.csv`: Contains rows of `(userID, movieID, rating)`.

### Model

- Uses **Create MLâ€™s `MLRecommender`**, which learns a vector for each user and movie in a shared latent space.

### Inference

For each movie \( m \), the recommender computes:

Where:
- \( u_{user} \): vector for the user
- \( v_m \): vector for the movie

Movies are ranked by **dot product**, returning the **top-K unseen items**.

## Content-Based Filtering

Content-based filtering recommends movies based on genre similarity.

### Data

- `movies.csv`: Contains rows of `(movieID, title, genres)`.

### Feature Encoding

- Builds a **one-hot vector** \( g_i \in \{0, 1\}^D \) for each movie, where each position corresponds to a genre.

### Similarity Computation

For a target movie \( g_1 \), the system computes **cosine similarity** with every other movie:

Returns the **top-K most similar movies**.

## How the App Works

1. **On Launch**:
   - Loads `ratings.csv` and `movies.csv` from the app bundle.

2. **Collaborative Recommendations**:
   - Initializes `MovieRecommender` using `ratings.csv`.
   - Filters ratings for **User 1**.
   - Calls `prediction(items:k:restrict:exclude:)` to get top-5 suggestions.
   - Maps prediction output to movie titles.

3. **Content-Based Recommendations**:
   - Initializes `ContentBasedRecommender`.
   - Builds one-hot vectors from genres in `movies.csv`.
   - Calls `similarityScores(similarTo:topK:)` to get top-5 similar movies.

4. **UI**:
   - Displays both recommendation lists and a brief algorithm summary in a **SwiftUI List**.
